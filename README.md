## Little Detail:
#### This application makes 3 get requests every 4 seconds to the api using redux and middleware redux saga. And the requests are as follow:
1. First request is to drone api requesting *lat and lng* (thats how the marker on the map moves)
2. Second request takes those lat lng generated by previous request and calls the weather api for *city data and woeid* to make the third request.
3. Third request takes the woeid and fetches the *weather data/forcast and state/region locations*.
#### Then the data get stores in the store by saga in json form which then is supplied to the rest of the appilcation to render out to the screen.
